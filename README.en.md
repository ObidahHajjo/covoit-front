A **production-ready** carpooling REST API built with **Laravel 12**, **PHP 8.2+**, **PostgreSQL**, and a **custom local JWT system**.

The project follows a **clean layered architecture** with strict separation of concerns, authorization Policies, real-time messaging via Reverb, structured caching, Resend transactional emails, and robust test coverage.

> ⚠️ **Important note**: this application intentionally does **not** use Laravel's default `/api` prefix. Endpoints are exposed directly: `/auth/login`, `/trips`, `/cars`, etc.

# 🏗 Architecture

Strictly separated layered architecture:

```
HTTP
└── Controllers
    └── Requests (validation)
    └── Resources (transformation)

Application
└── Services (business orchestration)
    ├── DTOs (input normalization)
    └── Resolvers (reference resolution)

Domain
└── Models (Eloquent)
└── Policies (authorization)

Infrastructure
├── Repositories (interfaces + Eloquent implementations)
├── Support/Cache (RepositoryCacheManager)
├── Security (JWT issuer)
└── Clients (OpenRouteService)
```

Service/Repository bindings are registered in `AppServiceProvider` and `RepositoryProvider`.

### 🔎 Applied Principles

- Strict separation of concerns (Single Responsibility)
- Repository Pattern (interfaces + Eloquent implementations)
- DTOs for input validation and normalization
- Authorization via Policies (with admin bypass)
- Tagged cache (read-through / write-through)
- Real-time broadcasting via Laravel Reverb
- Transactional emails via Resend
- OpenAPI documentation (Swagger / l5-swagger)
- Robust unit and feature tests (PHPUnit 11)
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions + SonarQube

# 📦 Business Model

## Core Entities

- **User** — authenticated identity
- **Person** — profile aggregate linked via `users.person_id`
- **Car** — vehicle belonging to a person
- **Trip** — ride published by a driver
- **Reservation** — passenger booking for a trip
- **Conversation / ConversationMessage** — private messaging tied to trips
- **Brand / CarModel / Type / Color** — vehicle catalog data
- **Address / City** — geographic data
- **Role** — user role (`admin` / `user`)

## Key Business Rules

### 👤 Person / User
- Registration simultaneously creates a `Person` and a `User`
- Has one vehicle (optional) via `persons.car_id`
- Has a role (`admin` or `user`)
- Can be deactivated (`is_active = false`) — access blocked by middleware
- Soft-deleted accounts can be restored on login for **90 days**
- After 90 days: automatic anonymization by the `accounts:purge-deleted` command

### 🚗 Trip
- `available_seats > 0`
- `distance_km > 0`
- Cannot be cancelled once it has started
- Creation flow: ORS geocoding → distance/duration calculation → persistence + derived `arrival_time`

### 📌 Reservation
- Composite primary key (`person_id + trip_id`)
- Driver cannot book their own trip
- No duplicate bookings
- No overbooking (available seats are checked)
- Not possible on an already-started trip

### 💬 Conversation
- Two-party threads around a trip
- A driver can contact a passenger on their trip
- A passenger can contact the driver of a trip

# 🔐 Authentication (Local JWT)

The API uses a local JWT-based authentication system (HS256). It does not depend on any third-party service: token generation, validation, and rotation are entirely handled server-side.

## 🧩 Authentication Architecture

| Token | Lifetime | Usage |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `access_token` | Short-lived (e.g. 1h) | Access to protected routes |
| `refresh_token` | Long-lived (e.g. 30 days) | JWT renewal |

## 🔄 Authentication Flow

### 1️⃣ The user registers or logs in via:
```
POST /auth/register
POST /auth/login
```

### 2️⃣ The server:
- Verifies credentials and `is_active` status
- Hashes the password (bcrypt)
- Generates an HS256-signed JWT `access_token`
- Generates a random `refresh_token` (`random_bytes(32)`)
- Stores the hashed refresh token in the database (`refresh_tokens`)
- Returns tokens in JSON **and** sets them as secure HTTP-only cookies

### 3️⃣ The client sends the JWT via:
```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```
or via the `access_token` cookie (HTTP-only).

### 4️⃣ The `jwt` middleware (`LocalJwtAuth`):
- Verifies the signature (HS256)
- Verifies `iss`, `aud`, `exp` claims
- Resolves `sub` → `User`
- Caches the token → user mapping (TTL aligned with token expiration)
- Loads `auth()->user()`

---

# 🧾 JWT Structure

```json
{
  "iss": "couvoit-api",
  "aud": "couvoit-client",
  "iat": 1700000000,
  "exp": 1700000900,
  "sub": "12",
  "role_id": 1,
  "user_id": 1,
  "jti": "a1b2c3d4e5f6..."
}
```

## 🔎 Claims Used

| Claim | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `iss` | Issuer |
| `aud` | Audience |
| `sub` | Internal user identifier |
| `exp` | Expiration |
| `role_id` | User role |
| `jti` | Unique token identifier |

---

# 🔁 Refresh Token (Secure Rotation)

## The refresh token:
- Is generated via `random_bytes(32)`
- Only the raw value is returned to the client
- Is stored **hashed** in the database (`refresh_tokens`) with an expiration date
- Is revoked on every rotation

## 🔄 Endpoint
```
POST /auth/refresh
```

## Process:
1. Verification of the provided refresh token
2. Revocation of the used token
3. Generation of a new `access_token` + `refresh_token` pair

### This strategy protects against:
- Token theft
- Replay attacks
- Reuse after compromise

## 🔒 Logout

```
POST /auth/logout
```
Deletes **all** refresh tokens for the authenticated user.

---

# 🔒 Security

- Password hashed via **bcrypt**
- JWT signed via **HS256** with a long secret (≥ 32 bytes)
- Refresh token rotation on every renewal
- Full revocation support (logout)
- Inactive users (`is_active = false`) blocked by middleware
- Centralized JWT middleware (`LocalJwtAuth`)
- HTTP-only cookie with configurable `Secure` and `SameSite` settings

---

# ⚙ Configuration `.env`

```env
# JWT
JWT_SECRET=base64:...
JWT_ACCESS_TTL=3600
JWT_REFRESH_TTL=2592000
JWT_ISSUER=couvoit-api
JWT_AUDIENCE=couvoit-client

# Auth Cookies
AUTH_COOKIE_PATH=/
AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN=null
AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=false
AUTH_COOKIE_SAMESITE=lax
```

---

# 💬 Real-Time Messaging

Real-time messaging is handled via **Laravel Reverb** (Pusher-compatible).

## Architecture

- Broadcasting configured in `bootstrap/app.php`
- Private channel authorization in `routes/channels.php`
- Event: `App\Events\ChatMessageSent` (implements `ShouldBroadcastNow`)
- Broadcast authentication exposed via `POST /broadcasting/auth-proxy`

## Private Channels

```
chat.user.{personId}
chat.conversation.{conversationId}
```

## Messaging Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/conversations` | List conversations |
| GET | `/conversations/{conversation}` | Conversation detail |
| POST | `/conversations/{conversation}/messages` | Send a message |
| POST | `/trips/{trip}/contact-driver` | Contact the driver |
| POST | `/my-trips/{trip}/contact-passenger/{person}` | Contact a passenger |

> `/chat/conversations...` aliases are also available.

## Start Reverb locally

```bash
php artisan reverb:start
```

---

# 📧 Transactional Emails

Emails are sent via **Resend** with configurable templates.

## Covered Events

- Password reset
- Reservation created (passenger & driver)
- Reservation cancellation (passenger & driver)
- Trip cancellation (passengers)

> Template variable documentation is available in `docs/resend-trip-templates.md`.

> ⚠️ Email sending is done **synchronously** (no queue job) after database commit.

4. Runs tests
5. Generates code coverage
6. Runs SonarQube scan (if secrets are configured)

---

# 📌 Cache

Caching is a real part of the architecture, not just a framework default.

## Architecture

- Centralized coordination in `app/Support/Cache/RepositoryCacheManager.php`
- Tags defined for: persons, cars, brands, models, cities, colors, trips, reservations, types
- Route model bindings cached for: `person`, `trip`, `brand`, `car`
- JWT middleware caches token → user mapping (TTL aligned with token expiration)
- Trip creation: ORS geocoding/routing responses cached for **24 hours**

## Example keys:

```
persons:all
person:{id}
cities:{name}:{postal}
trips:all
trip:{id}
```

- Default TTL: **3600 seconds**
- Automatic invalidation on create/update/delete operations
- Redis recommended in production (required for cache tags)

> ⚠️ The application relies heavily on cache tags — **Redis is mandatory in production**.

---

# 🛡 Authorization

## Main Policies:

| Policy | Covered Model |
|--------|---------------|
| `PersonPolicy` | Profile and role management |
| `CarPolicy` | Vehicle management |
| `TripPolicy` | Trip publishing, editing, cancellation |

## Key behavior:

- **Admins**: bypass via `before()` on all policies
- **Users**: can only manage their own profile and vehicle
- **Drivers**: trip publishing reserved for drivers (`canPublishTrip()`)
- **Trip owners**: only they can update/cancel their trips
- **Helpers on `User`**: `isAdmin()`, `isDriver()`, `canPublishTrip()`, `canBookTrip()`

## Admin bypass:

```php
public function before(Person $user): ?bool
{
    return $user->isAdmin() ? true : null;
}
```

---

# 📍 Creating a Trip

1. Validation via DTO
2. Verification that the driver owns a car
3. Reference resolution (Brand, Type, Model, Color, Addresses)
4. Geocoding of both endpoints via ORS (with 24h cache)
5. Distance & duration calculation via ORS (with 24h cache)
6. Derived `arrival_time` calculation
7. Trip persistence
8. Return of the refreshed model with relations

---

# 🔄 Scheduled Tasks

Declared in `routes/console.php`:

| Command | Frequency | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `auth:clear-resets` | Every 15 min | Clean up expired password reset tokens |
| `accounts:purge-deleted` | Daily | Anonymize accounts deleted for more than 90 days |

### Manual execution:

```bash
php artisan accounts:purge-deleted
```

> The Laravel scheduler must run every minute on your server.

---

# 🌍 Deployment

## Recommended stack:

- VPS (e.g. Hetzner)
- Ubuntu 22.04+
- Apache or Nginx (pointing to `public/`)
- UFW Firewall
- Cloudflare DNS
- SSL Let's Encrypt
- **Redis in production** (mandatory for cache tags)
- Reverb as a separate process (if real-time chat is enabled)
- Laravel scheduler (`* * * * * php artisan schedule:run`)

## Production checklist:

- Configure `APP_URL` and `FRONTEND_URL` correctly (generated links, cookies)
- `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=true` over HTTPS
- Review `AUTH_COOKIE_SAMESITE` based on context
- Provide `JWT_SECRET`, `OPENROUTESERVICE_API_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, and Resend template IDs
- Generate and publish Swagger docs as appropriate

## Dockerfile

A `Dockerfile` based on `php:8.5-apache` is provided with PostgreSQL and Redis extensions enabled, and Apache configured to serve from `public/`.

## 📌 Important Notes

- All protected routes go through the `jwt` middleware (`LocalJwtAuth`)
- Authorization is handled via `CarPolicy`, `TripPolicy`, and `PersonPolicy`
- Admins benefit from a bypass via `before()`
- Inactive users (`is_active = false`) are blocked at the middleware level
- Routes do **not** use the default `/api` prefix

---

# 🔧 Troubleshooting

### `Missing Bearer token`
- Send `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` or rely on the `access_token` cookie
- Verify the request is hitting a protected route and cookies are being transmitted

### `Token expired` or unexpected auth failures
- Call `POST /auth/refresh` with a valid refresh token
- If config changed: `php artisan config:clear`
- If cache is stale: `php artisan optimize:clear`

### Trip creation fails with ORS errors
- Verify `OPENROUTESERVICE_API_KEY`
- Confirm departure and arrival addresses are geocodable by ORS
- Check logs: `php artisan pail --timeout=0`

### Real-time chat not receiving events
- Verify `BROADCAST_CONNECTION=reverb`
- Ensure `php artisan reverb:start` is running
- Confirm the client authenticates via `POST /broadcasting/auth-proxy`
- Verify the authenticated user belongs to the requested private channel

### Cache tag errors or inconsistent cached reads
- Prefer Redis in runtime environments (required for tagged caches)
- After changing config or cache driver:
```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
```

### Emails are not sent
- Verify `MAIL_MAILER=resend` and `RESEND_API_KEY`
- Verify Resend template IDs in `.env`
- If template IDs are blank, email sending is silently skipped

### `composer setup` or `composer dev` fails on npm commands
- This backend repository has no committed `package.json`
- Use PHP/Artisan commands directly instead

---

# 🔄 Roadmap

- Redis in production (full configuration)
- Email dispatch via Laravel Queue jobs
- Event-driven architecture
- API versioning (`/v1/...`)
- Rate limiting per role
- Full Dockerization (docker-compose)
- Complete CI/CD GitHub Actions pipeline
- WebSockets for real-time trip status updates
